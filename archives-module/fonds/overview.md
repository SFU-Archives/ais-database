# Processing Projects: Overview
A `Processing Project` is a time-delimited program of work (has start / end dates) to arrange and describe a set of records from one or more related `Fonds` or `Collections`.

The main purposes of the AIS `Processing Project` table are to:
- Document archival processing activities and generate processing statistics.
- Provide an interface for managing the removal of processed `URC Boxes` and the creation of new `Containers`, `Objects`, and `AIPs`.
- Support the creation of standardized *Processing reports*, documenting decisions and issues relating to fonds and collections as they are arranged and described.
