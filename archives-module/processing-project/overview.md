# Processing Projects
A **processing project** is a time-delimited program of work (has start / end dates) to arrange and describe a set of records from one or more related [Fonds](../fonds/overview.md) or Collections.

The main purposes of the AIS ProcessingProject table are to:
- Document archival processing activities and generate processing statistics.
- Provide an interface for managing the removal of processed URC Boxes and the creation of new Containers, Objects, and AIPs.
- Support the creation of standardized *Processing reports*, documenting decisions and issues relating to fonds and collections as they are arranged and described.
