# Archives Information System (AIS) Database
SFU Archives has a custom FileMaker database to support its internal administrative and program activities. This site provides documentation and guidelines for use. The system and documentation is organized into separate but linked modules. Documentation is a work-in-progress and the site will be updated as new materials are added.
